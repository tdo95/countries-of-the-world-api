## About the API
All relevant information about the API such as countries available, endpints, and api properties can be found in the [documentation]().

Some countires may not have all property data. Unavailable data properties are represented by an empty value. e.g. empty string values are `''`, empty array values are `[]`.

## How it's made  üèó
**Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), [Cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio)

Data contained in the Countries of the World API was scraped from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states) using the Axios and Cheerio modules. Data retained is stored in a file on server and used to serve information via the API endpoints.

## Features üì±
- Two Enpoints: string match, entire api collection
- Ten data properties: `capital`, `wikiLink`, `flag`, `gini`, `gdp`, `population`, `drivingSide`, `currency`, `countryName`, `officialLanguages`

## Lessons Learned üéñ
- How to use logic to traverse webpages with inconsistent document structures
- Remove accent marks from text using the `normalize()` and `replace()` methods
- Scrapping across sites without standardized document structures is difficult and ineffienct, should look into how to approach this effectively

## Future Improvements üìä
- Add ISO and sign to currency property
- Incoorporate pre-existing data in the [world-countries](https://www.npmjs.com/package/world-countries) database
- refractor `fillInData()` function into smaller parts for readability
- clean up inputs for GDP and Population
